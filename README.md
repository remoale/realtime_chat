# Real-Time Chat

Secure chat rooms that are automatically destroyed after 10 minutes, with all messages wiped from the database.

### Tech Stack
- Next.js 16
- Tailwind
- Redis
- Elysia

### What I learned

- Redis TTL: Built self-destructing data models with 10-minute expirations.
- Elysia.js & Bun: Created high-performance, lightweight API architectures.
- Upstash Realtime: Implemented event-driven sync to eliminate server polling.
- End-to-End Type Safety: Bridged Next.js and backend with unified TypeScript patterns.
- Dynamic Sessions: Programmatically generated secure room IDs via Next.js.
- Token Auth: Secured private rooms with stateless, token-based authentication.
- Real-Time UI: Managed instant message delivery and client-side state sync.
